The goal of these three scripts is to have a consistent way to install the things I want configured on any linux distribution. Maybe part of setup.sh?

Servers and Desktops get different things, there is obviously for now let's focus on arch servers and fedora desktops, but leave room for other alternatives. Fedora Servers and Arch desktops having the most potential.

All Devices
1. vim, and one that can use the system clipboard.
2. Docker, also allowing the running user full rights to run docker stuff.
3. screen and tmux
4. python3 & pip
5. node version manager, with the lts version of node installed by it
6. Dev tools if they are available (dnf group install development-tools)
7. git & configure git with name and email, potentially prompting for that info up front.

2. Firefox
3. VS Code (official) (system)
